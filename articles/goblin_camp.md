I would maybe post Goblin Camp here if it was worth hosting myself

*..is what I would have said...*

Turns out you can just embed directly from itch.io, this place is wonderful <3
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed-upload/9338453?color=333333" allowfullscreen="" width="640" height="380"><a href="https://steved.itch.io/goblin-camp-alpha">Play Goblin Camp (alpha 6) on itch.io</a></iframe>

This'll actually work when Goblin Camp moves from Alpha to Beta.

`TODO: work on Goblin Camp instead of a deranged website`
