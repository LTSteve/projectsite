## Consistency is for losers

The more you focus on consistency the more likely you are to bail on a project just because you haven't touched it in a while.  No, only bail on a project when there's nothing else you can get from it (that you couldn't easier by starting a new project). This is, maybe, a bit of a departure from the cult of done, but not by much.

As an aside, (and for my future reference next time I go a while between updates) I'm hosting this project using render.com, the site is automatically deployed when a new commit is pushed to the master branch of the git repo.

Anyway, soon, maybe tomorrow, I'll post a project idea I had around using Bevy and Godot to make games. It also includes a plan on turning those game projects into a bit of a content farm on youtube seeded from my own material. I do, at some point, still want to make money from my hobbies after all (even as I see it's a pipe dream with too many issues to post here), and as we all know: Art can't turn a profit without becoming content first.
