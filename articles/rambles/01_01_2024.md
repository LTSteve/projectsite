*I'm actually writing this the 31st of December 2023*

I have a bit of a manic energy tonight

I think I got itch.io embeds working, which is nice. Although I won't know for sure until I make Goblin Camp public (duh)

That means I can now post Rambles, Games, AND Music here. Also weird javascript shit posts and whatever else I want...

*...hmmm...*

Now that I think of it [Click Me](#give_wolv_claw) to gain **The Left Wolv Claw**.

<script type="module">
    import { inventory } from "/scripts/widgets/inventory.js"
    const l_wolv_claw = "The Left Wolv Claw";

    window.addEventListener("give_wolv_claw", (e)=>{
        inventory.addItem(l_wolv_claw, "items/left_wolv_claw.md");
    }, false);
</script>

My solution to navigating rambles is just to add a link to the last one
