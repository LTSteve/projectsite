Had a thought today, this whole exercise feels self-indulgent. You know, making stuff in general can feel this way. I don't think I'll heed that feeling though

I'll take doing something self-indulgent over doing nothing at all

Really isn't it the most conceited thing in the world to want to do something original, special, something no one's ever done before?

Yeah, my ideas are derivative - I don't even know what they're derived from - I don't always have time to think about it, I'd rather be creating
