## The Eternal Bevy Project Content Farm

### Plan:
- Make a bunch of projects with Bevy, starting simple and getting more complex as time goes on
- Take notes on the development of these projects (just using git commits is probably fine)
    - When these projects are completed, create a blog here to sum up the project as a whole
- Continue until there are enough projects that keeping a weekly schedule of uploads seems trivial
    - These videos should be split in a feature-by-feature way, Ideally spreading each simple project into enough pieces to cover around 6-8 uploads of about 10 minutes
- Make a bunch of these videos (10 or 20) as a buffer
- Release Videos from this list while simultaneously working on new projects and new videos
- Eventually, split videos into "simple game" videos (something like "I made Snake in Bevy in 5 hours!" shit like that), "complex game devlog updates", and opinion/tier lists

A key aspect to this content is selling myself as competent and confident. Content of this sort works on an aspirational level, I need the simple projects I'm working on to feel simultaneously *attemptable* and *impressive*

A video format that will likely work for me:
- Keep it simple
- Scripted
- Short
- To-The-Point
- Dry humor
- Let the project speak for itself
- Allow myself to enthuse about things I'm enthusiastic about
- 10 mins
- Preamble (set the scene) - Problem Statement - One or Two solutions that didn't work - The solution that did work - Surprise impact + What can you learn? - What's next?
