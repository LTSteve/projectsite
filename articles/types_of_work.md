## Two types of work

I'm unaware of other thoughts on this topic, if I had to guess I'd say this train of thought fits pretty neatly into some philosophy or other, but I don't read much

*Maybe someday I'll fix that, maybe I won't, who cares...*

### Type 1

Work that you only do for external reasons. Or, put another way, for other people. In our society this generally means work we'd only do if we get paid for it

### Type 2

Work that you'd do for yourself with no external influence. Passions. Self-improvement, though, only in it's pure form (self improvement for the cause of social standing is maybe hard to separate)

Most work is both of these in bits and parts. A horrible job may be entirely **Type 1**, playing some video games can probably count as **Type 2**. Dispite the naming of these (**1** and **2**) I have no intention of assigning some sort of value hierarchy to these. But a useful theory around this concept is that anything that gets you paid requires at least some **Type 1** work
