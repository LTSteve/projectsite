## Welcome to |projectsite|

This is a freeform space for me to blog, shitpost, create

*Plans are still up in the air for this site, but check back often, whatever I do project-wise should be ending up on here in some form*

[Today's ramble](rambles/01_01_2024.md)
[Broken Link](asdf/12_31_2023.md)
[An embeded Godot game?](goblin_camp.md)

These posts are written in MD and parsed on the front end

They're not even sanitized. That's a security no-go, but I doubt you'll be entering any compromising info here so it's whatever

Commiting changes every time I update the site may seem icky, but separating code from content seems against the vibe of this place

*..vibe still in progress*

~*separating code and content*~

`also this is not mobile friendly, but I'm not sure I care?`
